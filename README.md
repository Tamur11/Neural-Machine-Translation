# Assignment 4 (Neural Machine Translation)

Solution to Assignment 4 of Stanford's Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning (XCS224N) course.

Synopsis on Neural Machine Translation with RNNs:
In Machine Translation, the goal is to convert a sentence from the source language (e.g. Spanish) to the target language (e.g. English). In this assignment, I implemented a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) network with attention, to build a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) system.
